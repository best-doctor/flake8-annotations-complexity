An extension for flake8 to report on too complex type annotations.

Complex type annotations often means bad annotations usage,
wrong code decomposition or improper data structure choice.
They are also hard to read and make code look java-like.

Annotation complexity is maximum annotation nesting level.
So `List[int]` complexity is 2 and `Tuple[List[Optional[str]], int]` is 4.

Default max annotation complexity is 3 and can be configured
via `--max-annotations-complexity` option.

## Installation

```bash
pip install flake8-annotations-complexity
```

## Example

Sample file:

```python
# test.py

def foo() -> List[int]:
    return [1]
```

Usage:

```terminal
$ flake8 --max-annotations-complexity=1 test.py
test.py:4:14: TAE002 too complex annotation (2 > 1)
```
